		<h2>Reflection of ATM</h2>
			<p>Overall, the ATM program has been very helpful to me. I am able to learn and discover new programs that I havenâ€™t done or heard of. ATM has been useful to me to other classes like English, history, and science. Many projects that I have done sometimes use Word or Powerpoint. ATM is very helpful for any future job. Every year, the world is getting more and more advance through technology. I think students with an interest in computers will enjoy learning and exploring new programs that ATM offers.</p>
