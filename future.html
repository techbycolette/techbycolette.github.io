		<h1>My Future</h1>

		<h2>High School</h2>
			<p>I have applied to the California Academy of Mathematics and Science and plan to go there. I also have applied to Lakewood High School for Merit Scholars and Wilson High School for WAVE. I have applied to schools that have programs that specialize in fields that I might go into like science and engineering or academics. <a target="_blank" href="http://dash.ga.co/colettedo/build-your-own-business-website">More about these high schools</a></p>

		<h2>College</h2>
			<p>So far, I have not planned what college I want to go to. The colleges that I might want to apply for are <a target="_blank" href="https://www.caltech.edu/">Caltech</a>, UCLA, USC, or UC Berkeley. Caltech has great programs in technology and engineering, while UCLA has a great biology program, so those are my top two schools.</p>

		<h2>Career Interests</h2>
			<p>Some of my career interests is technology and engineering. I might want to go into website engineering or a software engineering. I really like dealing with computers and software. I am really interested in seeing who goes behind all these amazing websites. Or, I am thinking of working as an editor for a movie or a screenwriter. I am a creative person and I like to write during my free time. Working on a movie or TV set would really fit my interests because I would love to see what goes behind the scenes of a movie or TV show and be apart of it.</p>
