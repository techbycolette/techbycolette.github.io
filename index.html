		<h2>My Family</h2>
		<p>I have three other people in my family. My dad works at a car repair shop. My mom stays at home to watch my sister and I. My sister Janet is three years older than me and is in high school. My parents are from Vietnam, so my family is a Vietnamese American family. We try to incorporate both Vietnamese traditions and American traditions into our lifestyle.</p>
